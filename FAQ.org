* Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
** Q: The ~rommel~ command generates an error: ~SpawnModel: Failure - model name turtlebot3_waffle already exist.~
    A: This is a known issue with the ~rommel~ command (or ~roslaunch sternformost
       rommel.launch~ command). *Nothing to worry about!* Gazebo might show a black
       screen after generating this error. *Still, nothing to worry about.* Just
       wait and the world with the TurtleBot3 will be loaded eventually.  The
       loading process might take some time, due to the large amount of
       models. Just sit back and relax, everything will be alright.
