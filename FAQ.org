* Frequently asked questions (FAQ)
** Q: The ~rommel~ command generates an error: ~SpawnModel: Failure - model name turtlebot3_waffle already exist.~
    A: This is a known issue with the ~rommel~ command (or ~roslaunch sternformost
       rommel.launch~). *Nothing to worry about!* Just wait and the world with the
       TurtleBot3 will be loaded eventually.  The loading process might take
       some time, due to the large amount of models. Just sit back and relax,
       everything will be alright.
